# ##⚠️ Notes:
# rsa is for key encryption/decryption of committee members.

# dlib and face-recognition are optional and should only be included if you're using facial recognition. They're excluded on Windows in the file above using a condition (platform_system!="Windows"), since dlib often causes installation issues there.

# opencv-python is needed for image capture and webcam-based verification.

# Pillow is used for image handling if you’re saving/processing user images.

# Make sure to install cmake and dlib manually on Windows if needed, or remove them from the list if not using facial recognition
